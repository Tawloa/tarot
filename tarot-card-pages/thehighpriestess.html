        <img src="../tarot-card-imgs/the-high-priestess.png" alt="The High Priestess in The Lit Path deck" style="max-width: 200px;">
        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>The first woman in the Major Arcana, card number two. She is a symbol of pure holiness. The inner part of our self that is always whole, always uninjured, always the stoic witness to our internal source. The representation of our boundless potential.</p>
        <p>In this deck, the High Priestess is separated from the viewer by a bright, pure fire - the symbol of her internal work. She may seem cold or unapproachable, but that's only because she is so deep into her own journey of her internal source or connection to the divine.</p>
